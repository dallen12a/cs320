How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure it is important to implement private as well as public variables. To maintain functionality consistent testing of the code in blocks as you build and develop is the best avenue. I found through repetitive debug cycles that I encountered string and loop issues I may not have otherwise noticed.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The best way to interpret user needs is through user sessions where you find out the requirements through open-ended questioning. You then translate wwhat they have provided to you into clean well commented code. After initiating this code and covering what is believed to be all the requirements it is important to present again and see if the requirements were met to the stakeholders agreement. If not, active suggestions on what they invisioned differently. If so, what else you could incorprorate or is the program finished as-is. It is important to comment code as you write as well - this ensures the need is incorproated into the program and how it is utilized.

How do I approach designing software?

Software is a balancing act between what you have written and what you have heard. For me, the approach is collecting all the requirements and seperating them into digestible elements and tackling them a block of code at a time crossing off whatever has been deemed "finished". I continue to test each block as I write to ensure variables are declared and used properly and elements like index and loops are free of bugs. Then I take the opportunity to comment above the code the requirement it fulfilled - this is a build process for me - so before releasing product as complete that section of commenting becomes omitted.
